Art to Wear is a collaborative show between NC State's College of Design and College of Textiles students. Art to Wear's past Art and Design Faculty Advisor, Vita Plume, along with a couple of Anni Albers Scholars initiated the show in 2002. It was held in 'the pit' at the College of Design with merely a hundred spectators. Art to Wear now resides in Reynolds Coliseum playing host to an audience of over 3500 attendants annually. This eclectic show has always emphasized a fusion of art and fashion, making it anything but your typical fashion show.

Art to Wear 2011 will take place on April 12, 2011 at 7 p.m. in Reynold's Coliseum.
