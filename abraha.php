Abraha is a very interesting project. When Thomas contacted me, we didn’t have a lot of communication before. He generally introduced me about their mobile game product and told me this animation will serve as the teaser for their new game, Am al-Fil : Charge Of The Elephants. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Soon after that, Thomas emailed me with a rough script about this animation.
</br>
1. 15-20 seconds of still shots of desert scenes</br>
2. Close up of desert ground with small stones that begin to  rattle on the ground as some heavy footfalls hit the ground nearby and shake them</br>
3. Blowing sand - a sandstorm - suddenly a huge, mean war elephant takes shape out of the blowing sand, heading straight for the camera</br>
4. cut to black, words appearing &quot;King Abraha returns - July 2013&quot;  and maybe a web address.
</p>
<p>
This script helped me find out what kind of animation he wanted, and how long it should be, also what kind of visual style fits this animation the best.
</p>

Ancient battle field, desert scene, war elephant, these words naturally reminded me the ending sequence of the movie 300. I think using the similar 2.5D technique, and engraving silhouette will very well depict the violence and the history that embedded in this project. With these initial thoughts in my mind, I started searching inspirations right away. During the research, I found a lot of photos of desert scene and charging elephant on line. In order to put together a mood board, I started sorting those images out, and keeping only that match the overall style of this animation. This process is very important in the pre-production; in a great degree, it determins the color choice, the textures and even the entire visual guidance of this project.

<p>The next step is the real beginning of the production of this teaser animation. Firstly, I created digital images based on the mood board, and applied the engraving silhouette style to each image. These images also had to be in 16:9 aspect ratio, this helped me a lot in the animating process. When I finished creating these images, I put them in the sequence according to the script and generated a styleboard, which was the final visual guide for this project.</p>

Instead of animating first and adding the music afterwards, I personally like finding the music first and animating according to the rhythm of the music. This will not only help me match up the rhythm of the animation and the audio, it also helps me get inspired and stay motivated when I am animating. In my mind, I think the background music for this animation should be mysterious and have a strong sense of savage, fast paced rhythm as well. After several rounds of picking and comparing, I found a piece of music called </span><span class="c1">Dark Base</span><span> on line. The drum beats in its main rhythm is a perfect way to reveal an old nerve wrecking battle field.
</p>
<p>
After I found the perfect background music, I imported the music file and all the digital images I created earlier into After Effects. In order to match with the length of the animation and the cut points, I also lined up each image based on the music and edited the music file a little bit. Then everything is ready to be animated. Besides the camera animation, there is an effect animation in this piece, it is sandstorm effect. I wanted the sandstrom to be as real as possible, but also marry the same visual style. It is not easy to create a sandstorm in perspective, especially, it also needs to come towards the camera and cover the whole screen to reveal the charging elephant; so I did a lot of research about how to create a sandstorm in After Effects. Luckily, the powerful particle system in After Effects helped me created this sandstorm effect, and the animatic of the whole animation was almost done after this process. In the next, I polished a few details, added a moving red cloth in the second scene, which added the movement to a deadly quiet scene, also made the animation look more natural and interesting.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>During the first round of review of this animation, Thomas gave me a very important comment. He told me the animal skull in the third scene shouldn’t appear in the middle east desert. To fix this geographic mistake, I came up with a better plan, replace the animal skull with a old battle shield. I feel this will not only avoid the geographic mistake, it also implies the old battle field and the savage feeling we want to deliver here. Thomas agreed with my plan, after this round of review, we had the final animation you guys are watching now.

Like I said in the beginning, this was a very interesting animation project; not only because it was fun to create and using new techniques; also because I learned some interesting background story about king Abraha. It was really a pleasure to work with Thomas. I cannot wait to see their game come out on the market and bring all the gamers a big blast!
