The Norman Mclaren project started as an assignment of my animation history class. The professor gave each student an important figure in animation history, asking us to utilize the new media technology to reintroduce these historic figures. I was given the guy named Norman Mclaren. After a lot of research about this guy and watching plenty works of his, I found out he was a famous Canadian Animation after world war II. But the problem came after. Those works which were so successful back in the 1930s were already out of date nowadays. If I just use his works as the footage to make a simple introductory video like what other students did, it would be a very boring piece, at least it would not be visually appealing to my audience. So I decided to redesign his art and attach my unique style into it, using the format of title sequence, which is my specialty and interest point, to tell a short story about Norman's life. With this idea in mind, I started story boards sketching and style picking, and after several days studio work, the final piece you see here came out. I was worried that this piece wouldn't fit in the professor's criteria. But it turned out my radical innovation was welcomed by the professor and the students, they gave me a lot of very positive feedback on this piece. Now, I am pretty happy with the final result, just wish I could get some extra credit from this piece.
