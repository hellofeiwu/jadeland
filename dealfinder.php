<h4>Ecommerce App UX Design</h4>
<p>
This is a project with IBM design department. I, together with my team, Michael Delaney, Derek MacLellan, Greg Pray and Sebychu, designed and prototyped a location based Ecommerce shopping application "Dealfinder" to help the users finding hot deals while they are shopping in the physical world. Particularly, it combines the joy of window shopping and deal searching together; makes deal searching and shopping behavior seamless and pleasant.
</p>
<h5>Demand analysis:</h5>
<p>
With the help of smart phones, on-line shopping became very easy and popular. Every shopper would try to find a hot deal before they make the payment. Currently this sequence of shopping behavior would still happen in the virtual world. The shoppers have to wait for a while until the product been delivered to them. What if the hot deals are just in our reachable distance? Can we just go and purchase them off-line? Obviously, most shoppers prefer this way.
</p>
<p>
Hence, our goal is to help our users find those hot deals around them, and navigate them to those deals in the physical world. To make this shopping experience happen, the app will need three major components: a map system, a GPS and an on-line shopping system.
